# Semantic replacement

# Replaced div with the class "header" to header tag. 
 
# Replaced the first div after H1 to nav. This will make it more clear that it is the navigation part of the page. This also required me to replace that div in css with nav.
 
# Replaced "hero" class div to main tag as it is the main content of the page. 

# Replaced "content" class with section tag.

# Replaced each div after new section tag to article tag.#  

# Replaced the div with the class "benefits" with aside, to help point out that it is on the side of the page.

# Replaced every div after new aside tag with article tag.

# Replaced div with the class "footer" to the tag footer.

# Replaced h2 in the footer with h4 as it is the least important header
